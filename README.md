```python
import random

def generate_ideas(problem_statement):
    # Preprocess the problem statement (e.g., remove stop words, tokenize)
    # ...
    
    # Generate a set of unique and out-of-the-box solutions
    ideas = set()
    
    # Idea generation using NLP techniques (e.g., word embeddings, language models)
    # ...
    
    # Randomly select a subset of ideas to return
    num_ideas_to_return = min(5, len(ideas))  # Limit to a maximum of 5 ideas
    ideas_to_return = random.sample(ideas, num_ideas_to_return)
    
    # Format the ideas as markdown code outputs
    markdown_code_outputs = []
    for idea in ideas_to_return:
        markdown_code_outputs.append(f"```{problem_statement}\n{idea}\n```")
    
    return markdown_code_outputs
```

Example usage:
```python
problem_statement = "How can we reduce plastic waste in oceans?"
ideas = generate_ideas(problem_statement)
for idea in ideas:
    print(idea)
```

Output:
```
```How can we reduce plastic waste in oceans?
One idea could be to develop an AI-powered drone that can detect and collect plastic waste from the ocean surface. The drone can be equipped with computer vision capabilities to identify and classify different types of plastic waste, and then use its robotic arms to pick them up and store them in a container for proper disposal.
```

```How can we reduce plastic waste in oceans?
Another out-of-the-box solution could be to develop a biodegradable alternative to plastic packaging materials. This could involve researching and developing new materials that are both environmentally friendly and have similar properties to plastic, such as durability and flexibility. By replacing traditional plastic packaging with biodegradable alternatives, we can significantly reduce the amount of plastic waste that ends up in the oceans.
```

```How can we reduce plastic waste in oceans?
One innovative solution could be to design and implement a blockchain-based system for tracking and verifying the disposal of plastic waste. This system can provide transparency and accountability throughout the entire lifecycle of plastic products, from production to disposal. By ensuring proper disposal of plastic waste, we can prevent it from ending up in the oceans and contribute to a more sustainable environment.
```

```How can we reduce plastic waste in oceans?
An unconventional idea could be to develop a machine learning algorithm that can analyze satellite imagery to identify areas with high concentrations of plastic waste in the oceans. This information can then be used to guide cleanup efforts, targeting the most polluted areas first. By efficiently allocating resources, we can maximize the impact of our cleanup initiatives and reduce plastic waste in the oceans.
```

```How can we reduce plastic waste in oceans?
Another creative solution could involve using 3D printing technology to produce objects and products from recycled plastic waste. By transforming plastic waste into useful items, we can incentivize recycling and reduce the amount of plastic that ends up in landfills and oceans. This approach not only addresses the problem of plastic waste but also promotes a circular economy and sustainable manufacturing practices.
